In Next.js 15, a relatively uncommon bug can occur when using the `app` directory and server components with dynamic routes and data fetching.  The issue manifests when data fetching within a server component relies on parameters from the URL, but those parameters are not correctly propagated or available within the component's `async` function. This can lead to unexpected errors or empty data being displayed, particularly if your data fetching uses `async/await` with promises.  For instance, if you have a server component fetching data based on an id parameter (`/users/[id]`), an error might happen if the `id` is not correctly passed to the server component during rendering.
